# English-Class-Dashboard

## Introduction
Reflecting on my past experience as a teacher, I wish I had possessed the skills I have now as a data analyst. I have realized how teachers can benefit from incorporating data analytics into their work, and I want to offer my skills to help them do so. With a desire to improve student performance and provide the best education possible, I used Excel to create a dashboard using my old gradebook from early in my teaching career.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard provides an overview of how students performed in English class during Term 1, measured on three competencies: 
- C1: Uses language to communicate and to learn
- C2: Reads and listens to texts
- C3: Produces different texts

To protect student privacy, I created student IDs to appear on the dashboard rather than their names.

Designing the dashboard was an interesting experience for me, as I aimed to make the data easy to understand. Having been a teacher, I knew how crucial it was to present data in a simple and straightforward manner. I made sure to highlight the average grades for each competency and the class average.

The class novel for Term 1 was "That Is Then, This Is Now" by S.E. Hinton, and the top assignments were highlighted in the graphs, including the accumulation for overall quizzes, test grades, and the article the students wrote about a particular scene in the book. The grades were also divided into intervals to get a better analysis overall.

## Observations
- I noticed a negative skew in the quiz and test grades, indicating that some students may have struggled with understanding the material or keeping up with the class.
- Providing additional support to these students can help them catch up and improve their understanding of the material.
- The article graph showed a normal distribution, with the majority of the class scoring in the 75-80 range.
- It's important to recognize that these students are performing well and to investigate why some students are consistently performing poorly.
- It was observed that the same students had the lowest average for each competency, which is a new observation but important.
- This information will be helpful as the year goes forward, as it allows for providing additional support and resources where they are needed most.

## Conclusion
As a former teacher, I know the importance of using data to inform our teaching and improve student outcomes. By creating this dashboard, I was able to use my data analysis skills to help students succeed in the classroom. Now, as a data analyst, I am eager to continue using my skills to help educators make data-driven decisions that will benefit their students.
